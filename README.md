# Personal Goals and Restrictions

- The system must have a clean and modern appearance, attractive to the eyes
- Must be mobile ready
  - Support swipe events
- Should use minimal other tools and libraries
  - Develop everything that is feasible, personally
- For faster loading time it will save some basic data on local storage
- Restrict whenever possible the data and images used to what pokeapi offers
- Add small animations to make the site ludic 
- Add accessibility elements
- Extra images will be donne by myself
